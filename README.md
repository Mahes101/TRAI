# TRAI
Project Title: Explore Data Speed
Problem Statement:
The TRAI of Indian Government Telecomunication contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to process that data  to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
Business Use Cases:
The penetration of wireless data networks has increased significantly in recent years. In creasing usage of smartphones and availability of various services on the Internet has led to more intensive use of wireless data networks by an expanding user base. Along with the increase in demand, changing market dynamics in the wireless services sector and reduced data tari s have also contributed to the significant increase in data consumption on mobile networks, particularly so in the last few months. With these developments, the issue of quality of service (QoS) of wireless data networks has become all the more important.
TRAI has also taken initiatives to empower customers to measure and report observed quality of wireless data networks. The TRAIMySpeed mobile app launched last year is designed to serve this purpose. 

APPROACH:
Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.  
Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.
